## Test Process

### Core Components
1. Distribution Assumptions 
2. Hypotheses (假设)

## Common Pitfalls

- Stopping test too early ("peeking")
- Multiple testing problem
- Insufficient sample size
- Seasonality effects
- Improper randomization
- Simpson's paradox

## Common test 

- Multivariate testing (A/B/n tests)
- Bayesian A/B testing
- Multi-armed bandit algorithms
- Sequential testing
